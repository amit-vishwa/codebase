 *
 * Java ArrayList is a part of collections framework and it is a class of java.util package. It provides us with dynamic arrays
 * in Java. Though, it may be slower than standard arrays but can be helpful in programs where lots of manipulation in array is
 * required. The main advantage of ArrayList is, unlike normal arrays, we donâ€™t need to mention the size when creating ArrayList.
 * It automatically adjusts its capacity as elements are added or removed.
 *
 * Important Features of ArrayList in Java
 * ArrayList inherits AbstractList class and implements the List interface.
 * ArrayList is initialized by size. However, the size is increased automatically if the collection grows or shrinks if the objects are removed from the collection.
 * Java ArrayList allows us to randomly access the list.
 * ArrayList can not be used for primitive types, like int, char, etc. We need a wrapper class for such cases.
 * ArrayList in Java can be seen as a vector in C++.
 * ArrayList is not Synchronized. Its equivalent synchronized class in Java is Vector.
 *
 * In the above illustration, AbstractList, CopyOnWriteArrayList, and AbstractSequentialList are the classes that implement the
 * list interface. A separate functionality is implemented in each of the mentioned classes. They are:
 * i.AbstractList: This class is used to implement an unmodifiable list, for which one needs to only extend this AbstractList Class
 * and implement only the get() and the size() methods.
 * ii.CopyOnWriteArrayList: This class implements the list interface. It is an enhanced version of ArrayList in which all the
 * modifications(add, set, remove, etc.) are implemented by making a fresh copy of the list.
 * iii.AbstractSequentialList: This class implements the Collection interface and the AbstractCollection class. This class is used
 * to implement an unmodifiable list, for which one needs to only extend this AbstractList Class and implement only the get()
 * and the size() methods.
 *
 * Operations                       Time Complexity     Space Complexity
 * Inserting Element in ArrayList   O(1)                O(N)
 * Removing Element from ArrayList  O(N)                O(1)
 * Traversing Elements in ArrayList O(N)                O(N)
 * Replacing Elements in ArrayList  O(1)                O(1)
