/**
 * @FunctionalInterface annotation is used to ensure that the functional interface can’t have more than
 * one abstract method. In case more than one abstract methods are present, the compiler flags an
 * ‘Unexpected @FunctionalInterface annotation’ message.
 * However, it is not mandatory to use this annotation.
 *
 * Some Built-in Java Functional Interfaces
 * Since Java SE 1.8 onwards, there are many interfaces that are converted into functional interfaces. All these interfaces are annotated with @FunctionalInterface. These interfaces are as follows –
 *
 * Runnable –> This interface only contains the run() method.
 * Comparable –> This interface only contains the compareTo() method.
 * ActionListener –> This interface only contains the actionPerformed() method.
 * Callable –> This interface only contains the call() method.
 *
 * Java SE 8 included four main kinds of functional interfaces which can be applied in multiple situations as mentioned below:
 * Consumer
 * Predicate
 * Function
 * Supplier
 *
 * Amidst the previous four interfaces, the first three interfaces,i.e., Consumer, Predicate, and Function, likewise have additions that are provided beneath –
 * Consumer -> Bi-Consumer
 * Predicate -> Bi-Predicate
 * Function -> Bi-Function, Unary Operator, Binary Operator
 *
