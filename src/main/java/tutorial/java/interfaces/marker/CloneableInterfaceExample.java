/**
 *
 * Marker interface in Java
 * It is an empty interface (no field or methods). Examples of marker interface are Serializable,
 * Cloneable and Remote interface. All these interfaces are empty interfaces.
 *
 * Cloneable interface is present in java.lang package. There is a method clone() in Object class.
 * A class that implements the Cloneable interface indicates that it is legal for clone() method to make
 * a field-for-field copy of instances of that class.
 * Invoking Objectâ€™s clone method on an instance of the class that does not implement the
 * Cloneable interface results in an exception CloneNotSupportedException being thrown.
 * By convention, classes that implement this interface should override Object.clone() method.
