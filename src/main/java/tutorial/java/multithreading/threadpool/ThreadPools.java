 * Server Programs such as database and web servers repeatedly execute requests from multiple clients and these are oriented
 * around processing a large number of short tasks. An approach for building a server application would be to create a new thread
 * each time a request arrives and service this new request in the newly created thread. While this approach seems simple to
 * implement, it has significant disadvantages. A server that creates a new thread for every request would spend more time and
 * consume more system resources in creating and destroying threads than processing actual requests.
 * Since active threads consume system resources, a JVM creating too many threads at the same time can cause the system to run
 * out of memory. This necessitates the need to limit the number of threads being created.
 *
 * A thread pool reuses previously created threads to execute current tasks and offers a solution to the problem of thread cycle
 * overhead and resource thrashing. Since the thread is already existing when the request arrives, the delay introduced by thread
 * creation is eliminated, making the application more responsive.
 * - Java provides the Executor framework which is centered around the Executor interface, its sub-interface â€“ExecutorService and
 * the class-ThreadPoolExecutor, which implements both of these interfaces. By using the executor, one only has to implement the
 * Runnable objects and send them to the executor to execute.
 * - They allow you to take advantage of threading, but focus on the tasks that you want the thread to perform, instead of thread mechanics.
 * - To use thread pools, we first create a object of ExecutorService and pass a set of tasks to it. ThreadPoolExecutor class
 * allows to set the core and maximum pool size.The runnables that are run by a particular thread are executed sequentially.
 *
 * As seen in the execution of the program, the task 4 or task 5 are executed only when a thread in the pool becomes idle. Until
 * then, the extra tasks are placed in a queue.
 *
 * Risks in using Thread Pools
 * i.Deadlock : While deadlock can occur in any multi-threaded program, thread pools introduce another case of deadlock, one in
 * which all the executing threads are waiting for the results from the blocked threads waiting in the queue due to the
 * unavailability of threads for execution.
 * ii.Thread Leakage :Thread Leakage occurs if a thread is removed from the pool to execute a task but not returned to it when
 * the task completed. As an example, if the thread throws an exception and pool class does not catch this exception, then the
 * thread will simply exit, reducing the size of the thread pool by one. If this repeats many times, then the pool would
 * eventually become empty and no threads would be available to execute other requests.
 * iii.Resource Thrashing :If the thread pool size is very large then time is wasted in context switching between threads. Having
 * more threads than the optimal number may cause starvation problem leading to resource thrashing as explained.
 *
 * Tuning Thread Pool
 * The optimum size of the thread pool depends on the number of processors available and the nature of the tasks. On a N
 * processor system for a queue of only computation type processes, a maximum thread pool size of N or N+1 will achieve the
 * maximum efficiency.But tasks may wait for I/O and in such a case we take into account the ratio of waiting time(W) and
 * service time(S) for a request; resulting in a maximum pool size of N*(1+ W/S) for maximum efficiency.
 *
 * The thread pool is a useful tool for organizing server applications. It is quite straightforward in concept, but there are
 * several issues to watch for when implementing and using one, such as deadlock, resource thrashing. Use of executor service
 * makes it easier to implement.
