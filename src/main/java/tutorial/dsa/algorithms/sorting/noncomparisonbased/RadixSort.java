 *
 * Radix Sort is a linear sorting algorithm that sorts elements by processing them digit by digit. It is an efficient
 * sorting algorithm for integers or strings with fixed-size keys.
 *
 * Rather than comparing elements directly, Radix Sort distributes the elements into buckets based on each digitâ€™s
 * value. By repeatedly sorting the elements by their significant digits, from the least significant to the most
 * significant, Radix Sort achieves the final sorted order.
 *
 * Radix Sort Algorithm
 * The key idea behind Radix Sort is to exploit the concept of place value. It assumes that sorting numbers digit by
 * digit will eventually result in a fully sorted list. Radix Sort can be performed using different variations,
 * such as Least Significant Digit (LSD) Radix Sort or Most Significant Digit (MSD) Radix Sort.
 *
 * Time Complexity:
 * Radix sort is a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that sorts data with integer keys by grouping the keys
 * by the individual digits which share the same significant position and value. It has a time complexity of
 * O(d * (n + b)), where d is the number of digits, n is the number of elements, and b is the base of the number
 * system being used.
 * In practical implementations, radix sort is often faster than other comparison-based sorting algorithms,
 * such as quicksort or merge sort, for large datasets, especially when the keys have many digits. However,
 * its time complexity grows linearly with the number of digits, and so it is not as efficient for small datasets.
 *
 * Auxiliary Space:
 * Radix sort also has a space complexity of O(n + b), where n is the number of elements and b is the base of the
 * number system. This space complexity comes from the need to create buckets for each digit value and to copy the
 * elements back to the original array after each digit has been sorted.
