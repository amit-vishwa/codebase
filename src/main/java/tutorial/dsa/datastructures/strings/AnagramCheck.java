 * Check if two Strings are Anagrams of each other
 * Last Updated : 24 Oct, 2024
 * Given two strings s1 and s2 consisting of lowercase characters, the task is to check whether the two given strings are anagrams of each other or not. An anagram of a string is another string that contains the same characters, only the order of characters can be different.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * Input: s1 = “geeks”  s2 = “kseeg”
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: Both the string have same characters with same frequency. So, they are anagrams.
 *
 *
 * Input: s1 = “allergy”  s2 = “allergic”
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: Characters in both the strings are not same. s1 has extra character ‘y’ and s2 has extra characters ‘i’ and ‘c’, so they are not anagrams.
 *
 *
 * Input: s1 = “g”, s2 = “g”
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: Characters in both the strings are same, so they are anagrams.

     * 1.[Naive Approach] Using Sorting
     * The idea is that if the strings are anagrams, then their characters will be the same, just rearranged.
     * Therefore, if we sort the characters in both strings, the sorted strings will be identical if the
     * original strings were anagrams. We can simply sort the two given strings and compare them – if they
     * are equal, then the original strings are anagrams of each other.
     *
     * Time Complexity: O(m*log(m) + n*log(n)), where m and n are length of string s1 and s2 respectively.
     * Auxiliary Space: O(1) where the strings are mutable but O(n) in languages like Java, Python, C#, etc.
     * where strings are immutable.

     * 2.[Expected Approach 1] Using Hash Map or Dictionary
     * The idea is to use a hash map or dictionary count the frequency of each character in both the input strings.
     * If the frequency of every character matches in both strings, then the strings are anagrams.
     *
     * First, count the occurrences of each character in first string.
     * Then, decrement the count for each character in the second string.
     * If the strings are anagrams, all positions in the frequency array should be zero as any non-zero
     * position means that the frequency of that character is not same in both strings.
     *
     * Time Complexity: O(m + n), where m and n are length of string s1 and s2 respectively.
     * Auxiliary Space: O(26) = O(1). The input strings can only have lowercase letters, so there can be at most 26 distinct characters in the hash map.

     * 3.[Expected Approach 2] Using Frequency Array
     * Instead of using a hash map to store the frequency of each character, we can create a frequency array

     * decrement its count from the frequency array. If the strings are anagrams, all positions in the
     * frequency array will be zero. Any non-zero position means the frequency of that character is not
     * equal in both the strings.
