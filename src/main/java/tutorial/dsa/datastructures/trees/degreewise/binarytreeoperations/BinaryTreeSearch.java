 * 3. Searching in Binary Tree
 * Searching for a value in a binary tree means looking through the tree to find a node that has that value.
 * Since binary trees do not have a specific order like binary search trees, we typically use any traversal method to
 * search. The most common methods are depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS). In DFS, we start from
 * the root and explore the depth nodes first. In BFS, we explore all the nodes at the present depth level before
 * moving on to the nodes at the next level. We continue this process until we either find the node with the desired
 * value or reach the end of the tree. If the tree is empty or the value isnâ€™t found after exploring all possibilities,
 * we conclude that the value does not exist in the tree.
